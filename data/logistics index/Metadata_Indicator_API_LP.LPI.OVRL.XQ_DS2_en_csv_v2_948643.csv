"LP.LPI.OVRL.XQ","Logistics performance index: Overall (1=low to 5=high)","The Logistics Performance Index overall score reflects perceptions of a country's logistics based on the efficiency of customs clearance process, quality of trade- and transport-related infrastructure, ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, quality of logistics services, ability to track and trace consignments, and frequency with which shipments reach the consignee within the scheduled time. The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. 
Data are from the Logistics Performance Index survey conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. The 2023 LPI survey was conducted from September 6 to November 5, 2022. It provided 4,090 country assessments by 652 logistics professionals in 115 countries in all World Bank regions. Respondents evaluate eight countries on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. 
Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis. 
Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology are included in Appendix 5 of the 2023 LPI report available at: https://lpi.worldbank.org/report.","Connecting to Compete - Logistics Performance Index (LPI), World Bank (WB), uri: https://lpi.worldbank.org",
